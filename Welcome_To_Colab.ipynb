            "Guest 1: Welcome everyone to another edition of the Tony Siriani Podcast. I am thrilled to have owner Erzan with us. He is the head of Alliance Bernstein Private Wealth. So thanks for being with us, owner.\n",
            "Guest 2: Thank you, Tony. Thanks for having me.\n",
            "Guest 1: Well, my pleasure. Say, you know, Alliance Bernstein has an old, you know, well known name on Wall Street, right? So it and it has.\n",
            "Guest 1: History. Just do me a favor, give me an update on on on where it is today.\n",
            "Guest 2: Sure. I always joke with my colleagues that sometimes we are a well kept secret on Wall Street because we have always the global reach and scale of a large asset manager. We manage close to $800 billion, but then we still have an intimate private wealth management business. It's a entrepreneurial part of our culture and.\n",
            "Guest 2: Our integrated asset and wealth management business and I call it entrepreneurial and intimate because we operate out of 20 offices and we have 300 advisors. So you have a little bit of that global resources in the background that our clients and advisors can access, but we still have a strong culture that is tightly knit together and we are very proud of our history as well. Well, you know the.\n",
            "Guest 1: Whole that that brings up an immediate, you know, question for me, which is so you have 300.\n",
            "Guest 1: 300 billion is an enormous, you know, number, right? And you have 300 advisors and, you know, culturally the advisors and the money managers, I mean, they're sort of in proximity, right? And some of the offices. And I'm just wondering how, how that dynamic works to sort of help a wealth manager. You know, I'm, I'm thinking specifically, are they reaching out to the money manager? Are the money managers, you know, wanting to be part of that? Or how do you, how do you?\n",
            "Guest 2: Manage that? No, absolutely. I think it's something that really sets us apart.\n",
            "Guest 2: I really feel the connectivity and proximity to how the money is managed is a differentiated capability and insight we have. Let me use an example to bring it to life, right. So remember in 2022 we had some challenges with the regional banking crisis, right at that moment, you know, everybody including us got some got quite nervous about the direction of the markets, what's going to happen, what's going to.\n",
            "Guest 2: Into the financial system, banks, etcetera. And in that moment like within you know less than 24 hours, we were able to get our community bank equity product PM. We got the financial research team members from our different equity teams. We managed 20 separate active equity strategies on the asset management umbrella, which obviously supports both our wealth business, but also our third party distribution on the asset management side.\n",
            "Guest 2: And having that kind of connectivity and we put out a Zoom with all these subject matter experts, open it up to all of our advisors, Everybody could ask their questions. And then again, after another 24 hours, we opened it up to our clients. I think the speed and the breadth of experience that we can bring together is really remarkable. It was one of the really proud moments.\n",
            "Guest 2: At least in my experience, I.\n",
            "Guest 1: I think compare that to your, your typical RIA that has, you know, absolutely no access to that or.\n",
            "Guest 1: You know, typically it's really hard to get access to, to asset managers, you know, to talk to your clients or get information. So yeah, I consider that a huge advantage.\n",
            "Guest 2: No, absolutely. It also carries itself to now privates, right. So we also manage significant amount of private alternatives, primarily private credit assets around $60 billion. And you know recently again one other example to bring it to life, there's been a lot of questions about.\n",
            "Guest 2: About whether we hit the bottom in the real estate cycle, what's going to happen to commercial real estate, all those kind of questions. And we were able to curate a panel of, again, investors from our different private credit teams that we work with. And then we put them in a roadshow and put it in front of our clients in different local offices. Again, a great collaboration.\n",
            "Guest 1: It's a huge differentiator. You know, my feeling is that AI is coming, right? So AI is going to be able to, you know, it can only look backwards, right? And and it can only look at publicly.\n",
            "Guest 1: Created information, but it is going to be able to start saying well, these are the best ETFs and this is the best you know it's going to it's going to be a challenge for advisors. So if I'm looking to differentiate myself, I really need to have access to the private markets, right? Because that's something that AI can't do because it's not public information, right? So you're talking about giving yourself an advantage with clients. I think that in the future it's only going to get be more important.\n",
            "Guest 2: No 100% and.\n",
            "Guest 2: The other aspect of it is, you know, obviously.\n",
            "Guest 2: Investment solutions is, is critical. But the other way to differentiate is, you know, the holistic advice. I know it's a slightly overused word, holistic advice, but we really emphasize also on the softer aspects of the complexity of wealth, right, Given our focuses, high net worth and ultra high network clients, I mean we know that there is more demand for advice and holistic thinking.\n",
            "Guest 2: Post the COVID right now.\n",
            "Guest 2: People want to have more in person or remote but human touch. And within that, it's not only the hard content of the product or the, you know, financials behind the financial plan, but it's all about the broader thinking, whether it's a family governance, family values, succession in family businesses. There are a lot of broader topics that cannot be, I think it is today.\n",
            "Guest 2: Can be automated through generative AI or other forms of advanced analytics.\n",
            "Guest 1: You know, absolutely. And you also bring up a, you know, a point and advisers don't like to think about this, but but as a practical matter, you know, if you don't have 5 million dollars, $6 million, the estate planning thing becomes less and less important. But when you have over that number, you do really need somebody who's on top of it and can help you and access, you know, services. Because as a as a practical matter, you know, wealth managers need support, you know, attorneys, lawyers, whatever it might be, but the resources to do it.\n",
            "Guest 2: 100% and in our busy lives.\n",
            "Guest 2: Bringing it all together is also very important, right? So obviously we have a great network of state lawyers, other advisors, bankers, accountants and the list goes on. But ultimately you need to be able to put it all together and make it easy for the kind of individual to navigate the complexity, right? And having a little bit of an independent quote UN quote quarterback who could also, you know, sit on the side of the client to be able to put it together.\n",
            "Guest 2: And draw implications.\n",
            "Guest 1: Yeah yeah critically important and again differentiated from a standard ria that has to go out and search all that stuff you have to sort of you know put it together and you cobble together sort of a Frankenstein instead of having something that's you know organized.\n",
            "Guest 2: 100%, yeah. You know, again, it's the balance between having the scale and resources while not creating bureaucracies so they can be nimble and be really client driven, yeah.\n",
            "Guest 1: Yeah, that's great.\n",
            "Guest 1: And also, you know, relationship through equitable, it's a strong balance sheet. So that's that's also I think a differentiator from some of the other, you know, folks out there in the RIAA world or that are looking to roll up Rias. I mean, there's a that's the competition out there you.\n",
            "Guest 2: Know, yeah, for sure, again, we are quite unique in that regard as well. Obviously, we are also New York Stock Exchange listed, so we have our own.\n",
            "Guest 2: Sources of capital and can tap into capital markets through that.\n",
            "Guest 2: And then Equitable is a strategic shareholder and we have a lot of collaboration with them on different types of initiatives. You know, it's a wide range, but for instance, that's one of the private alternatives, one of the areas that we work with together with Equitable managing a large chunk of the Equitable balance sheet.\n",
            "Guest 1: Yeah, fantastic. Well, patient capital, right, that that's what you would call.\n",
            "Guest 1: That.\n",
            "Guest 2: Yeah, yeah. No, absolutely. I mean, look.\n",
            "Guest 2: You have been a pioneer and a veteran of this industry.\n",
            "Guest 2: You know this, I mean right now there's so much financial capital chasing opportunities in the space. I think there is a little bit of extreme bias on thinking about EBITDA and how many deals and all that. Obviously we are growth driven as well. But ultimately we take a long term view. We we want to be the patient capital looking for the right opportunities versus trying to solve for a number in a.\n",
            "Guest 1: Spreadsheet, yeah, yeah, I, I and I think that that that's another differentiator too, right. I mean.\n",
            "Guest 1: The the, the idea of long term and and that typically comports with an advisor trying to build an ultra high net worth business, you know as well, because I think those type of clients understand that.\n",
            "Guest 2: 100% And as you know, typically the wealth formation at the Ultra Network client level is tied to some liquidation or monetization event, right? It could be tied to a business.\n",
            "Guest 2: Or some other hard asset. So you need to take a long term view because you might not have all the liquid assets to manage on day one, but you need to stay with the client, add value and then.\n",
            "Guest 2: Wait for that day that they will have, you know, larger pools of liquid assets to be managed.\n",
            "Guest 1: No question about that. Well, something else I think that's interesting is so if I'm an RIAA and I'm on my own, right, I can see the advantages here because I've got, you know, it's not just the patient capital, it's the these resources and things that, that that you guys bring to the table. But one of the big concerns, you know, as our business ages, right and as advisors are getting older.\n",
            "Guest 1: It's really hard to find partners.\n",
            "Guest 1: It's really hard to get up. I mean, you could have all the plans you want for succession, but if you don't have anybody to execute it or you don't have a partner who's really needing to invest in your business or find somebody else to help you, it's really difficult to do, Yeah.\n",
            "Guest 2: 100% it's also lifetime worth of investments in these practices, right? So it's typically your baby and you need to find the the transition solution for yourself, for your family and for your clients. It's a very personal.\n",
            "Guest 2: Affair. So that's why I think it's important to understand the fit both between the advisor that's looking for a new platform and the platform itself. And I don't think there's one-size-fits-all. But again, for the advisors that are really kind of high net worth, also high net worth oriented looking for a longer term solution, very investment and holistic planning driven both hard and software elements of planning.\n",
            "Guest 2: I think we offer a pretty good.\n",
            "Guest 1: Solution. Yeah and and you know the ability maybe for trainees or there there's a there's a program where you can get some younger brokers involved in their businesses too A.\n",
            "Guest 2: 100% actually for the ones that have been in the industry for a long time, they know it. I mean Bernstein's training and advisor development has been one of the big kind of differentiators and calling cards we always.\n",
            "Guest 2: Have been a great contributor to the industry by attracting new talent to the industry, developing them in our model.\n",
            "Guest 2: And then that's part of the secret sauce, if you will, by having very committed, high high quality and highly performing advisors coming off the ranks from our recruiting system and training. But ultimately, you know, when you get to a larger scale, you need to balance your recruiting program as well. Of course, we will always be very driven by the fresh talents in terms of bringing and molding them in our model, but we also know that there are.\n",
            "Guest 2: Advisors out there, we can also incorporate into our teams at different levels. So it's not a single approach. We can use multiple paths to recruiting.\n",
            "Guest 1: Yeah. Well, and again, I think that the typical, you know, Rias that are out there that are, you know, rolling along with pop, you know, venture money and doing rollups, they don't have anything like that. There's just no, they just have no access to it.\n",
            "Guest 2: Absolutely.\n",
            "Guest 1: So if I was if, if you were when when you tell the story, I mean, we talked about a bunch of things that are, you know, highlights when you when you're sitting with advisors and telling, you know, the Alliance Bernstein story. What do you think resonates most with them out of all those things?\n",
            "Guest 2: I mean a the pure focus, right. So we are not a financial conglomerates and we are a pure asset and wealth management firm. So we understand and talk investments. We can deliver complex investment outcomes. I think with most of the advisors that pure focus and expertise matters.\n",
            "Guest 2: Second, given we have a long standing more than 50 years of history across both of these businesses.\n",
            "Guest 2: We are again publicly listed company also with a large shareholder. We can take a very long term view into building and growing businesses rather than looking for the short term monetary gain and exits. I think that long term patient capital that we touched on really resonates with the advisors because they're looking for individuals who can invest in their practice.\n",
            "Guest 2: And then the final thing is culture. I mean, culture is something that you can only experience.\n",
            "Guest 2: It's hard to talk about it, but I always take pride in not only our client centricity and that client fiduciary mindset with the pure fee based business model, but also at the same time I take pride in our internal collaboration because the magic happens when you bring the best of a firm in front of the clients. And I think we do a great job in terms of having that collaboration while we are very intellectually curious bunch and we might have different points of view.\n",
            "Guest 2: But ultimately, we bring the best together to serve the clients.\n",
            "Guest 1: So if I was sitting there, I guess prior to this conversation or prior to you and I talked, we've talked a couple times. So I would, I would have said, oh, this, you know, Alex Bernstein, it's really for breakaway advisors from wirehouse. I think that would be the the, but it's not just that, right. You got, it's a tell us a little bit about the type of advisors you're either looking for or that, that you, you, you, you you think work very well in your system. Yeah, sure.\n",
            "Guest 2: The the the targets.\n",
            "Guest 2: Profile would be first of all, again, high net worth and ultra network is our focus, right. So if you are focused on different types of client segments, maybe we.\n",
            "Guest 1: Might you have to be a nice person too?\n",
            "Guest 1: Right, you don't want to.\n",
            "Guest 2: Yeah, that, that too. So I think your client's profile matters because we are relatively sophisticated platform and and hence we lead with that and that will be important to have the right fit with the clients. We are definitely looking for advisors that kind of take a holistic approach to their clients is not only the as I mentioned.\n",
            "Guest 2: Just a ******** product focus product is important. You need to articulate your capital markets views, but ultimately how do you think about we can longer term financial planning, estate planning, business sales, how to be efficient with that, how to bring family governance, family values in certain cases on the higher end family office type of capabilities. So as AI think you need.\n",
            "Guest 2: A relatively holistic tinker as an advisor versus AI will just sell product quote UN quote, right? That's not the model we are looking for.\n",
            "Guest 2: And ultimately we are looking for entrepreneurial folks who are committed to growing their business because at the end of the day, great things happen when we are all growing together and that that is part of our DNA in the Bernstein private wealth, the entrepreneurial growth oriented culture.\n",
            "Guest 1: And that's RI, as you know, bank, you know, private bankers, bank people in the bank, all that, everything.\n",
            "Guest 2: 100%, yeah, exactly. I don't think we have a bias for one business model versus the other.\n",
            "Guest 2: Again, just that depends on the preferences and characteristics of the advisor himself or herself. And by the way, I'm emphasizing to herself part, I mean we believe one of the biggest opportunities in wealth management is the growing role of women in financial decision making as the main decision maker in main households. A because of growing female executives and leaders in different businesses, but also the whole.\n",
            "Guest 2: Demographics of.\n",
            "Guest 2: Woman inheriting more wealth and our ability to really have differentiated solutions for for for those clients.\n",
            "Guest 1: Yeah, we have a we have a great women's advisor network here at Advisor Hub. It works great. And 100%, you know, we're aligned with with that thinking it's just good business sense. So you know, help figure that out 100%. So lastly, believe it or not, we're already you know, 20 minutes or so, but.\n",
            "Guest 1: It's just my daughter just got in this business. So Speaking of women in the business, right, So thank you. She's studying for relationship with an old woman firm too. So it's kind of fun.\n",
            "Guest 1: And she studied to get her her license so.\n",
            "Guest 1: What if your kids are getting to this business? What are you telling me? You think there's a bright future here in wealth management or, or? What would you say?\n",
            "Guest 2: Absolutely. I'm very passionate about this business and I, I, I, I wish my kids who are young will be interested in financial services and wealth management. It will be fun to see them in action. The reason I'm very bullish is a, there's a lot of.\n",
            "Guest 2: Innovation in broader financial services and wealth management. So there's a.\n",
            "Guest 2: Evergreen opportunity to add value to clients as a financial advisor by bringing new set of tools capabilities. We haven't touched a lot on technology beyond the AI conversation. So technology offers a lot of opportunities both for clients and advisors to build really scalable practices really delight the clients with a differentiated experience whether storm boarding where there's a reporting, whether it's.\n",
            "Guest 2: The engagement overall, and on top of that there is a growing set of complexities in people's lives.\n",
            "Guest 2: You know, not to mention the shortage of time to spend on your personal financial affairs, but you know, think about all the things that you need to deal with, you know, now ETFs, Smas, alternatives, crypto and the list goes on.
